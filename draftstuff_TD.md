###Modelling for Team Selection

##Skill Index

For the Skill Index, when determining the skill level for each player, a weighted sum approach was used that employed the normalised statistics provided. The coefficients varied for each metric and position. An additional weighted sum for a total skill score was then calculated to aggregate all data. The coefficients were calculated utilising actuarial judgement, that considered the value of the metric through research and exploratory analysis of the skills stronger teams possessed in the tournaments, e.g. highest weightings were applied to skill success rates; weaker weightings to less desirable features. Some weightings were also applied to metrics that did not necessarily indicate skill but expressed a desirable level of experience as this would prevent selection of players that might have excellent success rates but very low attempts, e.g. 100% tackle success rate but only 2 total tackles attempted. This modelling was used for each skill area with weightings assigned based on the relevance of the statistic for the player, e.g. it is more critical that a forward is making tackles in the attacking third rather than the defending third. Further, many variables were perfectly correlated with each other such as the total tackle count and counts of tackles within each third. Their coefficients were set to account for multi-collinearity. 

This approach was chosen as there were no distinct response variables that could be used to model player skill levels other than a team’s tournament performance. Once these scores were created for each area, they were then added together in an additional weighted sum based on the importance of that skill area for the position such as how forwards need excellent shooting unlike defenders. Players were then ranked by total skill component and its simplicity is valuable due to its allowance for future adjustments as new skills may become more relevant for other matches.

The process for how the statistics were normalised and how the skill index was produced can be found here [INSERT LINK TO CODE].
The code begins by reading in all the data, normalising each relevant statistic, producing the individual skill area scores by position and then finally creating the total skill metric score. 

Visual analysis was first utilised to explore the data and brainstorm potential methods for modelling the data. Initially visual scatterplots were used to determine the importance of variables by observing each player’s normalised score for a statistic and their team’s position in the global tournaments. This analysis showed no prominent patterns across most statistics and showed some biased patterns across defensive statistics such as number of tackles. A defender should be capable of making tackles but weaker teams are generally more likely to be on the defensive and will naturally make more tackles, making it seem like a player is worse for having made more tackles.
